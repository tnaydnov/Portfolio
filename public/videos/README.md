# Project Demo Videos

This folder contains demo videos for your portfolio projects.

## Video Requirements:
- **Format**: MP4 (H.264 codec recommended)
- **Duration**: 10-30 seconds for preview, 1-2 minutes for detailed demos
- **Speed**: 1.5x to 2x speed to show more functionality quickly
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 or 1280x720 (16:9 aspect ratio)
- **File size**: Keep under 10MB for web optimization

## Current video files needed:
- `lpr-demo.mp4` - License Plate Recognition System demo
- `trading-demo.mp4` - E-Commerce Trading System demo  
- `hr-demo.mp4` - HR Management System demo

## Recording Tips:
1. **Clean workspace** - Clear desktop, organized windows
2. **Smooth navigation** - Slow, deliberate movements
3. **Key features** - Show main functionality, not setup
4. **No audio needed** - Videos are muted by default
5. **Start with overview** - Show the main interface first
6. **Demonstrate workflow** - Show typical user interactions

## Video Optimization:
After recording, compress videos using:
- HandBrake (free)
- FFmpeg
- Online compressors

Target bitrate: 2-4 Mbps for good quality/size balance.

## Fallback Behavior:
If video files are not available, the component will:
1. Show the static image
2. Display a play button overlay
3. Fall back to the generated tech pattern if no image

The portfolio will work perfectly even without videos - they're an enhancement!
